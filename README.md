# DS-SpMV
Data-specific SpMV codes for selected SuiteSparse matrices

This repository contains the codes used for the experimental results in the papers:

*(pldi19) Travis Augustine, Janarthanan Sarma, Louis-Noël Pouchet, Gabriel Rodríguez, Generating piecewise-regular code from irregular structures, 40th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, PLDI, Phoenix, AZ (USA), June 2019.

These are provided in raw form, as used during our experiments. They can be compiled using the provided Makefiles, and expect to receive as input the corresponding SuiteSparse file in RB format.

For help with compilation, execution or environmental setup, or for more details, contact gabriel.rodriguez@udc.es.
